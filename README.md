# cryptotool

- Need to add tests

- tests:


        - Generate two AES-256 components
        - Find each of their KCVs
        - XOR two components to get the key
        - Find KCV of the key
        - Check against openssl
        
        - Generate a random block of HEX data
        - Encrypt the block
        - Decrypt the block
